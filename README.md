# Intex PureSpa Remote
Control and monitor your Intex PureSpa remotely.

First push will be my existing project - warts'n'all.

It connects in parallel with the display lines,
'emulating' a 16bit shift register to read data parsing it
for MQTT use or direct Wifi connection.

Currently it uses an ESP8266 for prototype, though the ESP32
is tempting because of Bluetooth and dual-core will simplify and allow
for a little laziness in the monitoring!

NOTE:
There are several variations of the display unit and I only support model '11930'.

You can help expand support by:
- Sending clear, close photos of your display unit PCB - both sides.
or
- Sending me a PCB.
or
- Make a pull-request or gist of the changes.
